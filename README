 ---- ABOUT THE FILES ----
List.java:
Contains the List ADT to be used by the Matrix.java file.

ListTest.java:
This file was used to test the List ADT in List.java.
Within this file are some commented lines that can be 
used to activate the RuntimeException from List.java. 
In order to run this program please alter the Makefile 
to run ListTest.java instead of Sparse.java. 

Matrix.java:
This file conatains the Matrix ADT to be used by Sparse.java. 

MatrixTest.java:
This file was used to test the Matrix ADT in Matrix.java.
Within this file are some commented lines that can be 
used to activate the RuntimeException from Matrix.java. 
In order to run this program please alter the Makefile 
to run MatrixTest.java instead of Sparse.java. 

Sparse.java:
This is the main java file. It reads in a file, in1.txt, which 
contains data for matrices. Sparse.java utilizes the Matrix.java
file to build the required matrices. Arithmetic operations are 
perfromed on the matrices and the results are sent to an output
file (I called it out1.txt).

Makefile:
This Makefile is currently set to run the main file, Sparse.java.
This Makefile must be altered to run the MatrixTest.java file and
ListTest.java.
